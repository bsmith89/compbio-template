## Conventions ##
-  `16S.*` refer to sequence files which originally come from the rrnDBs
   16S sequence database.
-  `*.fn` means that a file is a nucleotide file in FASTA format.
-  `*.afn` is an aligned nucleotide FASTA.
-  `*.ungap.*` means that an alignment has had columns which are only
   composed of gaps ('-') removed.
-  `*.head.*` and `*.tail.*` are files which only represent the top or bottom
   fractions of the dataset, respectively.  These are to be used as sample data
   in testing scripts.
